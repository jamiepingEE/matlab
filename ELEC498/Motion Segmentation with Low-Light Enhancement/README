Motion Segmentation with Low-light Enhancement

Input: .y4m 
Output: .avi

Algorithm:
open stream

Takes in a low-light image
Gaussian Filter
Downsample
Enhances with LECARM (Ren et al. IEEE. TCSVT. Vol.29#4. April 2019)
Grayscale conversion
XOR (background and current frame)
binary; threshold=(mean frame pixel intensity)+(connected objects*5)
median filter; window size nxn; n=mean frame pixel intensity
