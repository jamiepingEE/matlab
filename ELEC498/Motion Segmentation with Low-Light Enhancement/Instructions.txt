Otherwise all discussed results are in folder "Final Report Results" at much smaller size; open with media player of choice

This code requires memory to store the frames and scalar mean values.
1. Run FinalBuildv1a.m MATLAB driver script on Matlab, press RUN.
2. Change only the lines 9-10 for different video file inputs and outputs respectively.

yuv4mpeg2mov.m is required to run the matlab function "yuv4mpeg2mov" and is included in project folder

Other files from journals are included:
LECARM.m

Linux command line conversion of any video taken by iPhone SE(1st gen), .MOV extension:

If you are using Slackware, you must get ffmpeg from sbopkg, if you do not have sbopkg, get it from slackpkg

1. Locate directory of videos to be converted e.g.: cd /my-videos
2. Open command line interface or console (e.g.: roxterm, konsole, bash, xterm, rxvt)
3. Type: ffmpeg -i my-video1.MOV -ss 00:00:02 -to 00:00:10 my-converted-video.mp4
Note: commands are case sensitive, -ss means start and -to means end of segment that you wish to cut out
the above cuts a video starting at 2s and ends at 10s, and outputs it as my-video-output.mp4
extension must be specified
4. Then type: ffmpeg -i my-converted-video.mp4 -pix_fmt yuv420p my-video-output.y4m
Note: the above line converts to .y4m format
5. Finally, type: sed -i '0,/C420mpeg2/s//C420/' *.y4m
Note: the above line is a stream editor for codec formatting, omission will result in error on matlab
